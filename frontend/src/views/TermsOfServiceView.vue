        <p>
            The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
            entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
            which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those

        <h2>13. GOVERNING LAW</h2>

        <p>
            These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of France, and the use of the United

            residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by
            obligatory provisions of the law in your country to residence. AbruptGames and yourself both agree to submit to
            the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hauts-de-Seine, which means that you may make a claim to defend
            your consumer protection rights in regards to these Legal Terms in France, or in the EU country in which you
            reside.

            constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
            right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal
